Interview the user in detail about unclear or missing areas in the requirements: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious. Be very in-depth and continue interviewing until all questions are answered and the requirements are clear. Then update the requirements document.
